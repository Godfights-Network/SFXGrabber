# SFXGrabber

A tool that listens to sound effect sequences (mainly on Hypixel) and translates them into code. Used for the Godfights Minecraft server.

## How the hell do I use this?

Well if you need this mod I'm going to assume you have the bare minimum expertise to clone a repository, understand the code a little, adapt it for your needs and build it. I'm not opposed to giving support as I don't believe the demand for a tool like this is very high but all I'm going to say is I'm sure you can figure it out
